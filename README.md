# cybersecurity-project-2
In this project I put to practice our class penetration testing skills.

I performed a Red Team attack into a vulnerable system. The ELK server logged the activity information, which the Blue Team reviewed through Kibana.

More details on the project and my findings will be included in the slideshow.
